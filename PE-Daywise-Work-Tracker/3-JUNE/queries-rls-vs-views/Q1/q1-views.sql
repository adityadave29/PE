-- Step 1: Disable RLS on lineitem
ALTER TABLE lineitem DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Drop existing view if any
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS lineitem_secure;

-- Step 3: Create view with same filter logic as RLS policy
CREATE VIEW lineitem_secure AS
SELECT l.*
FROM lineitem l
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM supplier s
    WHERE s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
    AND s.s_acctbal > 1000
);

-- Step 4: Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT ON lineitem_secure TO current_user;

-- Step 5: Run Q1 with timing
\timing on
